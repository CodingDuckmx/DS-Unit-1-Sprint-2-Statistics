# Lambda School Data Science - Unit 1 - Sprint 2

## Statistical Tests and Experiments

An important application of statistics is designing and evaluating experiments - in the context of web applications, often this means an A/B test where users are exposed to different versions of a site and their behavior/outcomes compared.

How do you design a good, and valid, experiment? When have you run your experiment long enough? How do you evaluate the outcome of an experiment? How do you balance all this math and science with the practical business/product concerns you’re working with? These are the sorts of questions we’ll discuss in this sprint.

Statistics is, in some ways, the most tolerant branch of mathematics - unlike its kin, statistics accepts situations where the exact and complete are unattainable. We’ve learned about the basic summary metrics provided by descriptive statistics - mean, median, mode, standard deviation - and how these can be represented both numerically and visually to help tell a story about data.

In this module, we’ll still use these metrics, but go deeper into their meaning and interpretation, in order to perform hypothesis tests that allow us to state with “confidence” conclusions about our data.
